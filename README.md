# Predicting League of Legends Analytics

We wish to build an website that could potentially help new and less experienced players who don't have much idea about the game, we could see that in today’s world the competitive gaming is emerging as a real career option, plenty of competitive games are offering tournaments with unimaginable prize pools, and even if we don't play competitive there are a plethora of options on joining youtube and presenting game analytics, also streaming live games is a good choice too, if they are interested. Also many people in today’s world don’t consider gaming as a real career option so our app could change the mindset of those kinds of people too.

So our website could provide a new direction in the field of competitive gaming, and encourage more and more players to choose gaming as their career, and will provide a tool that could help them in their initial phases. Our website can be used as a quick guide to learn and understand the League of Legends game in a much simpler and easier way.
